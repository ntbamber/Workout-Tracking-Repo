# Workout-Tracking-Repo
Simple workout tracking app/dashboard in Python I created using ChatGPT 4.0. This app is specialized for tracking progressive overload on a hypertrophy focused program, but could likely be modified to track other training styles.

Files:
- strong_converter.py: Personalized streamlit app to help me convert my csv file export from tracking app Strong.
- template_creator.py: Streamlit app used for creating/editing templates used by workout_logger.py.
- workout_dashboard.py: Streamlit app used for creating a dashboard to help track progress of lifts over time.
- workout_logger.py: Streamlit app used for logging workouts.
- requirements.txt: Required Python packages.
